# Proposed Template Enhancements for Upstream

## Summary

These proposed changes enhance the steering document templates with:
1. Dashboard and monitoring considerations
2. Real-time visibility features
3. Progress tracking capabilities
4. Future tunnel/sharing features

## Changes to Product Template

### In "Key Features" section, add:
```markdown
## Monitoring & Visibility (if applicable)
[How do users track progress and monitor the system?]

- **Dashboard Type**: [e.g., Web-based, CLI, Desktop app]
- **Real-time Updates**: [e.g., WebSocket, polling, push notifications]
- **Key Metrics Displayed**: [What information is most important to surface]
- **Sharing Capabilities**: [e.g., read-only links, exports, reports]
```

### In "Future Vision" section, add example:
```markdown
## Future Vision
[Where do we see this product evolving in the future?]

### Potential Enhancements
- **Remote Access**: [e.g., Tunnel features for sharing dashboards with stakeholders]
- **Analytics**: [e.g., Historical trends, performance metrics]
- **Collaboration**: [e.g., Multi-user support, commenting]
```

## Changes to Tech Template

### Add new section after "External Integrations":
```markdown
### Monitoring & Dashboard Technologies (if applicable)
- **Dashboard Framework**: [e.g., React, Vue, vanilla JS, terminal UI]
- **Real-time Communication**: [e.g., WebSocket, Server-Sent Events, polling]
- **Visualization Libraries**: [e.g., Chart.js, D3, terminal graphs]
- **State Management**: [e.g., Redux, Vuex, file system as source of truth]
```

### In "Development Environment" section, add:
```markdown
### Dashboard Development (if applicable)
- **Live Reload**: [e.g., Hot module replacement, file watchers]
- **Port Management**: [e.g., Dynamic allocation, configurable ports]
- **Multi-Instance Support**: [e.g., Running multiple dashboards simultaneously]
```

## Changes to Structure Template

### Add new section for dashboard organization:
```markdown
## Dashboard/Monitoring Structure (if applicable)
[How dashboard or monitoring components are organized]

### Example Structure:
```
src/
└── dashboard/          # Self-contained dashboard subsystem
    ├── server/        # Backend server components
    ├── client/        # Frontend assets
    ├── shared/        # Shared types/utilities
    └── public/        # Static assets
```

### Separation of Concerns
- Dashboard isolated from core business logic
- Own CLI entry point for independent operation
- Minimal dependencies on main application
- Can be disabled without affecting core functionality
```

## Additional Template: Dashboard-Specific Steering (Optional)

For projects with significant dashboard components, consider a dedicated `dashboard.md`:

```markdown
# Dashboard Strategy

## Purpose
[Why does this project need a dashboard? What value does it provide?]

## User Personas
[Who uses the dashboard and for what purposes?]

### Primary Users
- **[Persona 1]**: [Use cases and needs]
- **[Persona 2]**: [Use cases and needs]

## Information Architecture
[What information is displayed and how is it organized?]

### Key Views
1. **[View Name]**: [Purpose and main information displayed]
2. **[View Name]**: [Purpose and main information displayed]

## Real-time Requirements
[What needs to update in real-time vs. on-demand?]

- **Live Updates**: [What changes immediately]
- **Periodic Refresh**: [What updates periodically]
- **Manual Refresh**: [What requires user action]

## Performance Targets
- **Initial Load**: [Target time]
- **Update Latency**: [Target time from change to display]
- **Concurrent Users**: [Expected number]

## Accessibility & Sharing
- **Authentication**: [Required or open access]
- **Sharing Mechanism**: [How users share dashboard access]
- **Export Capabilities**: [What can be exported and in what formats]

## Future Enhancements
- **Tunneling**: [Secure remote access for stakeholders]
- **Mobile Support**: [Responsive design or dedicated apps]
- **Notifications**: [Alerts and notifications system]
```

## Rationale

These enhancements acknowledge that modern development tools often include monitoring and visibility features. By adding these sections to the templates, we:

1. **Guide developers** to think about visibility from the start
2. **Standardize dashboard approaches** across projects using the spec workflow
3. **Ensure consistency** in how monitoring features are documented
4. **Future-proof** for remote collaboration needs (like tunnel features)

The changes are optional (marked "if applicable") so they don't burden projects that don't need dashboards.
