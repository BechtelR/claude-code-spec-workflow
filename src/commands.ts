export function getSpecCreateCommand(): string {
  return `# Spec Create Command

Create a new feature specification following the spec-driven workflow.

## Usage
\`\`\`
/spec-create <feature-name> [description]
\`\`\`

## Instructions
You are helping create a new feature specification. Follow these steps:

**IMPORTANT**: After requirements approval, you MUST run the command generation script:
\`node .claude/scripts/generate-commands.js {feature-name}\`

1. **Create Directory Structure**
   - Create \`.claude/specs/{feature-name}/\` directory
   - Initialize empty requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md files

2. **Parse Feature Description**
   - Take the feature name and optional description
   - Begin the requirements gathering phase immediately
   - Do not ask sequential questions - generate initial requirements

3. **Generate Initial Requirements**
   - Use the requirements template from \`.claude/templates/requirements-template.md\`
   - Create user stories in "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]" format
   - Write acceptance criteria in EARS format (WHEN/IF/THEN statements)
   - Consider edge cases and technical constraints

4. **Request User Approval**
   - Present the requirements document
   - Ask: "Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design."
   - Wait for explicit approval before proceeding

5. **Generate Initial Task Commands** (REQUIRED after approval)
   - **MUST EXECUTE**: \`node .claude/scripts/generate-commands.js {feature-name}\`
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Run this command immediately after requirements approval
   - **PURPOSE**: Creates individual task commands in \`.claude/commands/{feature-name}/\`
   - **RESULT**: User can then use \`/{feature-name}-task-1\`, \`/{feature-name}-task-2\`, etc.
   - **NOTE**: Commands will be updated again when tasks.md is created in /spec-tasks

6. **Rules**
   - Only create ONE spec at a time
   - Always use kebab-case for feature names
   - Follow the exact EARS format for acceptance criteria
   - Do not proceed without explicit user approval
   - Generate task commands after requirements approval

## Example
\`\`\`
/spec-create user-authentication "Allow users to sign up and log in securely"
\`\`\`

## Next Steps
After user approval, proceed to \`/spec-design\` phase.
`;
}

export function getSpecRequirementsCommand(): string {
  return `# Spec Requirements Command

Generate or update requirements document for an existing spec.

## Usage
\`\`\`
/spec-requirements [feature-name]
\`\`\`

## Instructions
You are working on the requirements phase of the spec workflow.

1. **Identify Current Spec**
   - If no feature-name provided, look for specs in \`.claude/specs/\` directory
   - If multiple specs exist, ask user to specify which one
   - Load existing requirements.md if it exists

2. **Generate Requirements Document**
   - Use EARS format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
   - Structure: Introduction, Requirements with User Stories and Acceptance Criteria
   - Each requirement should have:
     - User story: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
     - Numbered acceptance criteria: "WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]"

3. **Content Guidelines**
   - Consider edge cases and error handling
   - Include non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
   - Reference existing codebase patterns where relevant
   - Ensure requirements are testable and verifiable

4. **Approval Process**
   - Present the complete requirements document
   - Ask: "Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design."
   - Make revisions based on feedback
   - Continue until explicit approval is received

## Requirements Format
\`\`\`markdown
# Requirements Document

## Introduction
[Brief summary of the feature]

## Requirements

### Requirement 1
**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria

  return `# Spec Tasks Command

Generate implementation task list based on approved design.

## Usage
\`\`\`
/spec-tasks [feature-name]
\`\`\`

## Instructions
You are working on the tasks phase of the spec workflow.

**IMPORTANT**: After tasks approval, you MUST run the command generation script:
\`node .claude/scripts/generate-commands.js {feature-name}\`

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Ensure design.md exists and is approved
   - Load both requirements.md and design.md for context
   - Understand the complete feature scope

2. **Generate Task List**
   - Break design into atomic, executable coding tasks
   - Use checkbox format with numbered hierarchy
   - Each task should reference specific requirements
   - Focus ONLY on coding tasks (no deployment, user testing, etc.)

3. **Task Guidelines**
   - Tasks should be concrete and actionable
   - Include specific file names and components
   - Build incrementally (each task builds on previous)
   - Reference requirements using _Requirements: X.Y_ format
   - Use test-driven development approach

4. **Task Format**
   \`\`\`markdown
   - [ ] 1. Task description
     - Sub-bullet with details
     - Specific files to create/modify
     - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3_
   \`\`\`

5. **Excluded Tasks**
   - User acceptance testing
   - Deployment to production
   - Performance metrics gathering
   - User training or documentation
   - Business process changes

6. **Approval Process**
   - Present the complete task list
   - Ask: "Do the tasks look good?"
   - Make revisions based on feedback
   - Continue until explicit approval

7. **Generate Task Commands** (REQUIRED after approval)
   - **MUST EXECUTE**: \`node .claude/scripts/generate-commands.js {feature-name}\`
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Run this command immediately after tasks approval
   - **PURPOSE**: Creates/updates individual task commands in \`.claude/commands/{feature-name}/\`
   - **RESULT**: Each task gets its own command: \`/{feature-name}-task-{task-id}\`
   - **EXAMPLE**: Creates \`/{feature-name}-task-1\`, \`/{feature-name}-task-2.1\`, etc.

## Task Structure
\`\`\`markdown
# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Setup project structure
  - Create directory structure
  - Define core interfaces
  - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [ ] 2. Implement data models
- [ ] 2.1 Create base model classes
  - Define validation methods
  - Write unit tests
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_
\`\`\`

## Next Phase
After approval and command generation, you can:
- Use \`/spec-execute\` to implement tasks
- Use individual task commands: \`/{feature-name}-task-1\`, \`/{feature-name}-task-2\`, etc.
- Check progress with \`/spec-status {feature-name}\`
`;
}

export function getSpecExecuteCommand(): string {
  return `# Spec Execute Command

Execute specific tasks from the approved task list.

## Usage
\`\`\`
/spec-execute [task-id] [feature-name]
\`\`\`

## Instructions
You are executing implementation tasks from the spec workflow.

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Ensure tasks.md exists and is approved
   - Load requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md for context
   - Identify the specific task to execute

2. **Task Execution**
   - Focus on ONE task at a time
   - If task has sub-tasks, start with those
   - Follow the implementation details from design.md
   - Verify against requirements specified in the task

3. **Implementation Guidelines**
   - Write clean, maintainable code
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
   - Include appropriate error handling
   - Add unit tests where specified
   - Document complex logic

4. **Validation**
   - Verify implementation meets acceptance criteria
   - Run tests if they exist
   - Check for lint/type errors
   - Ensure integration with existing code

5. **Completion**
   - **CRITICAL**: Mark task as complete in tasks.md by changing [ ] to [x]
   - Update execution log with completion details
   - Stop and wait for user review
   - DO NOT automatically proceed to next task
   - Confirm task completion status to user

## Task Selection
If no task-id specified:
- Look at tasks.md for the spec
- Recommend the next pending task
- Ask user to confirm before proceeding

## Examples
\`\`\`
/spec-execute 1 user-authentication
/spec-execute 2.1 user-authentication
\`\`\`

## Important Rules
- Only execute ONE task at a time
- **ALWAYS** mark completed tasks as [x] in tasks.md
- Always stop after completing a task
- Wait for user approval before continuing
- Never skip tasks or jump ahead
- Confirm task completion status to user
