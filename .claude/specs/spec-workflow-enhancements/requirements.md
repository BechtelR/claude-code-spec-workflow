# Requirements: Spec Workflow Enhancements

## Overview
Enhance the Claude Code Spec Workflow tool with advanced features to improve developer experience and workflow efficiency.

## User Stories

### 1. As a developer, I want the spec workflow to support parallel feature development
**Acceptance Criteria (EARS format):**
- WHEN multiple features are being developed simultaneously, the system SHALL maintain separate spec directories for each feature
- WHERE a developer runs the setup command multiple times, the system SHALL allow creation of additional features without overwriting existing ones
- WHILE working on multiple features, the dashboard SHALL display all active features with their current status
- IF features have dependencies, the system SHALL track and display these relationships

### 2. As a developer, I want better progress tracking and visualization
**Acceptance Criteria (EARS format):**
- WHEN viewing the dashboard, the system SHALL show percentage completion for each phase
- WHERE tasks are marked complete, the system SHALL automatically calculate and update progress metrics
- WHILE tasks are in progress, the system SHALL display estimated time to completion based on task velocity
- IF a phase is blocked, the system SHALL highlight this status prominently

### 3. As a developer, I want automated workflow validation
**Acceptance Criteria (EARS format):**
- WHEN moving between phases, the system SHALL validate that previous phase requirements are met
- WHERE validation fails, the system SHALL provide specific guidance on what needs completion
- WHILE in implementation phase, the system SHALL ensure only one task is active at a time
- IF workflow rules are violated, the system SHALL prevent progression and explain why

### 4. As a developer, I want integration with existing project management tools
**Acceptance Criteria (EARS format):**
- WHEN tasks are created, the system SHALL optionally export them to GitHub Issues
- WHERE a PR is created, the system SHALL link it to the corresponding spec and tasks
- WHILE using the workflow, the system SHALL support webhooks for external integrations
- IF external tools are configured, the system SHALL sync status bidirectionally

### 5. As a team lead, I want team collaboration features
**Acceptance Criteria (EARS format):**
- WHEN multiple developers work on the same project, the system SHALL support shared spec repositories
- WHERE specs are shared, the system SHALL track who is working on which tasks
- WHILE collaborating, the system SHALL prevent task conflicts through locking mechanisms
- IF merge conflicts occur in specs, the system SHALL provide resolution guidance

## Code Reuse Analysis Priority
Before implementing these enhancements, analyze:
1. Existing setup.ts structure for multi-feature support
2. Dashboard components for enhanced visualizations
3. Command generation system for workflow validation
4. Template system for new document types
5. Parser modules for progress calculation

## Success Metrics
- Setup time for new features reduced by 50%
- Developer context switching reduced through better organization
- Team adoption increased through collaboration features
- Workflow compliance improved through automated validation

## Non-Functional Requirements
- All enhancements must maintain backward compatibility
- Performance must not degrade with multiple active features
- Dashboard must remain responsive with 50+ active tasks
- Setup process must complete in under 5 seconds
