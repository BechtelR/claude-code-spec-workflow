# Bug Verification: Wrong Title Display

## Verification Summary
✅ **VERIFIED** - The bug fix successfully resolves the wrong title display issue.

## Test Execution

### Test Case 1: Original Bug Scenario
**Input**: Requirements file with `# Requirements Document ✅ APPROVED`
**Expected**: Display "Test Status Title" (formatted from directory name)
**Result**: ✓ PASS - Correctly displays "Test Status Title"

### Test Case 2: Status Indicator Detection
Tested the `isStatusIndicator()` method with various inputs:
- `✅ APPROVED` → Detected as status ✓
- `✓ APPROVED` → Detected as status ✓
- `APPROVED` → Detected as status ✓
- `WIP` → Detected as status ✓
- `IN PROGRESS` → Detected as status ✓
- `Feature Authentication` → Not detected as status ✓
- `User Management System` → Not detected as status ✓

### Test Case 3: Regex Pattern Behavior
Tested the updated regex with various title formats:
- `# Requirements Document ✅ APPROVED` → No match (falls back to directory name) ✓
- `# Requirements: User Authentication` → Extracts "User Authentication" ✓
- `# Requirements Document - Login System` → Extracts "Login System" ✓
- `# Payment Processing Requirements` → Extracts "Payment Processing" ✓
- `# Requirements Document WIP` → No match (falls back to directory name) ✓

## Verification Results

### Fixed Issues
✅ Status indicators no longer appear as spec titles
✅ "Requirements Document ✅ APPROVED" correctly falls back to directory name
✅ Directory-based names provide meaningful identification
✅ Legitimate feature titles still work correctly

### No Regressions Found
✅ Existing title extraction patterns still function correctly
✅ Valid feature names are not incorrectly filtered
✅ Parser continues to handle all documented title formats

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
1. **Added `isStatusIndicator()` method** - Detects common status patterns
2. **Updated regex pattern** - Better handles "Requirements Document" without separators
3. **Enhanced validation logic** - Checks for status indicators before using extracted text

### How It Works
1. Parser attempts to extract title from requirements.md
2. If no valid title found (e.g., "Requirements Document ✅ APPROVED"), falls back to directory name
3. Directory name is formatted (e.g., "test-status-title" → "Test Status Title")
4. Status indicators are properly filtered out

## Test Coverage

### Positive Cases Tested
- Requirements Document with status indicators
- Plain status indicators (✅, APPROVED, WIP, etc.)
- Requirements Document without meaningful titles

### Negative Cases Tested
- Valid feature names with emoji (not filtered)
- Legitimate titles in various formats
- Edge cases with mixed content

## Conclusion
The fix successfully addresses the bug where status indicators were displayed as spec titles. The implementation is robust, handles edge cases well, and doesn't introduce any regressions. The spec parser now correctly:
1. Detects and filters status indicators
2. Falls back to formatted directory names when appropriate
3. Preserves legitimate feature titles
