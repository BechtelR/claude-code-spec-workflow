# Bug Verification: Incorrect Bug Status Display in Dashboard

## Status
**Verified** - Fix implemented and tested successfully

## Fix Implementation Summary
Updated the italic text detection regex in `src/dashboard/parser.ts` from `/^\*.*\*$/` to `/\*To be [^*]+\*/` to properly detect template placeholder text in bug workflow files. Added detection for "**Pending**" status markers and expanded template phrase coverage.

## Test Results

### Original Bug Reproduction
- [x] **Before Fix**: Bug successfully reproduced - bugs with template content showed incorrect status
- [x] **After Fix**: Bug no longer occurs - template detection working correctly

### Reproduction Steps Verification
Re-tested the original steps that caused the bug:

1. Created new bug report using `/bug-create` command - ✅ Works as expected
2. Ensured bug has report.md, analysis.md, and verification.md with default template content - ✅ Works as expected  
3. Started the dashboard with `pnpm run dev:dashboard:backend-only` - ✅ Works as expected
4. Navigated to Bugs section via API - ✅ Works as expected
5. Observed bug statuses:
   - build-fails-typecheck: Shows as "reported" - ✅ CORRECT (was "analyzing", now fixed)
   - wrong-title: Shows as "analyzing" - ✅ CORRECT (has actual analysis content)
   - bug-wrong-status: Shows as "fixed" - ✅ CORRECT (has fix.md file)
   - dashboard-spec-complete-sorting: Shows as "resolved" - ✅ CORRECT (all phases complete)

### Specific Bugs Verified
- **build-fails-typecheck**: Now correctly shows "reported" (has only template content)
- **wrong-title**: Correctly shows "analyzing" (has actual analysis content)
- **bug-wrong-status**: Correctly shows "fixed" (has fix.md implementation)
- **dashboard-spec-complete-sorting**: Correctly shows "resolved" (verification complete)

## Regression Testing

### Related Features Tested
- [x] **Bugs with actual content**: Still show correct status progression
- [x] **Spec parsing**: Not affected by changes, continues to work correctly
- [x] **Dashboard display**: All other dashboard features function normally
- [x] **Bug workflow progression**: Status changes correctly as bugs move through phases

### Integration Points
- [x] **File system integration**: Parser correctly reads bug files
- [x] **WebSocket updates**: Status changes propagate correctly
- [x] **Multi-project support**: Fix works across all projects

## Edge Case Testing

### Template Detection Cases
- [x] **Multi-line italic text**: "*To be completed after\nfix implementation*" - Correctly detected
- [x] **Italic with other text**: "Some text *To be completed* more text" - Correctly detected
- [x] **Bold Pending markers**: "**Pending** - Not started" - Correctly detected
- [x] **Lowercase pending**: "pending implementation" - Correctly detected
- [x] **Various template phrases**: All "To be..." variations correctly detected

### Error Conditions
- [x] **Missing files**: Parser handles gracefully
- [x] **Malformed markdown**: No crashes or errors
- [x] **Empty files**: Correctly treated as no content

## Code Quality Checks

### Automated Testing
- [x] **Test suite created**: Comprehensive verification tests implemented
- [x] **All tests passing**: 100% success rate on test scenarios
- [x] **Edge cases covered**: Various template formats tested

### Code Review
- [x] **Code Style**: Follows existing project conventions
- [x] **Minimal changes**: Only modified necessary regex patterns
- [x] **No side effects**: Changes isolated to template detection logic
- [x] **Performance**: No impact - same O(n) complexity

## Verification Steps Completed

1. **Built the project** with the fix applied
2. **Created test scenarios** with various template formats
3. **Verified original bugs** now show correct status
4. **Tested edge cases** to ensure robustness
5. **Confirmed no regressions** in existing functionality

## Closure Checklist
- [x] **Original issue resolved**: Template content correctly identified
- [x] **No regressions introduced**: All existing features work
- [x] **Tests passing**: All verification tests successful
- [x] **Code quality maintained**: Follows project standards
- [x] **Fix is targeted**: Minimal, focused changes

## Notes
The fix successfully addresses the root cause - the overly restrictive regex pattern that only matched entire lines wrapped in asterisks. The new pattern specifically targets template phrases while preserving normal italic text in actual content.

Key improvements delivered:
1. Precise template phrase detection with `/\*To be [^*]+\*/`
2. Recognition of "**Pending**" status markers
3. Comprehensive template phrase coverage
4. Consistent implementation across parser methods

The bug fix has been verified thoroughly and is ready for production use.
