# Bug Verification

## Fix Implementation Summary
Client-side sorting logic was added to both single-project and multi-project dashboards to automatically re-sort specs when their status changes via WebSocket updates. The `sortSpecs()` method is now called after each spec update to maintain consistent order.

## Test Results

### Original Bug Reproduction
- [x] **Before Fix**: Bug successfully reproduced
- [x] **After Fix**: Bug no longer occurs

### Reproduction Steps Verification
Re-tested the original steps that caused the bug:

1. Opened Claude Code Spec Workflow dashboard - ✅ Works as expected
2. Created test spec in "in-progress" status - ✅ Works as expected
3. Completed all tasks in the spec (marked them as done) - ✅ Works as expected
4. Observed spec status change to "completed" - ✅ Works as expected
5. Spec automatically moved to correct position with other completed specs - ✅ Works as expected
6. No manual page refresh required - ✅ Achieved

### Regression Testing
Verified related functionality still works:

- [x] **Related Feature 1**: Initial page load sorting still works correctly
- [x] **Related Feature 2**: Manual refresh still applies correct sorting
- [x] **Integration Points**: WebSocket updates continue to work for all spec changes

### Edge Case Testing
Tested boundary conditions and edge cases:

- [x] **Edge Case 1**: Multiple specs changing status simultaneously - all re-sort correctly
- [x] **Edge Case 2**: Specs with same status sort by lastModified date (newest first)
- [x] **Error Conditions**: No errors thrown during sorting operations

## Code Quality Checks

### Automated Tests
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: All passing (some unrelated test failures exist)
- [x] **Integration Tests**: Dashboard functionality tests passing
- [x] **Linting**: No new linting issues
- [x] **Type Checking**: No new type errors

### Manual Code Review
- [x] **Code Style**: Follows project conventions
- [x] **Error Handling**: Appropriate null checks added in sorting functions
- [x] **Performance**: Minimal overhead - sorting only occurs on spec updates
- [x] **Security**: No security implications

- [x] **Tests passing**: All related tests pass
- [x] **Documentation updated**: Relevant docs reflect changes
- [ ] **Stakeholders notified**: Relevant parties informed of resolution

## Notes
The fix successfully addresses the original issue where completed specs would remain in their original position instead of automatically re-sorting to the bottom of the list. The implementation mirrors the server-side sorting logic on the client side, ensuring consistency across all update mechanisms.

Both single-project (`app.js`) and multi-project (`multi-app.js`) dashboards now properly re-sort specs when their status changes via WebSocket updates. The sorting algorithm correctly prioritizes specs by status (in-progress → tasks → design → requirements → not-started → completed) and then by last modified date within each status group.

No performance impact was observed during testing, as the sorting operation is lightweight and only triggered on individual spec updates rather than continuously.
