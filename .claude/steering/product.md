# Product Vision: Claude Code Spec Workflow

## Purpose

The Claude Code Spec Workflow is a developer tool that ensures good development outcomes through a proven, structured methodology. It transforms ad-hoc feature development into a systematic process that maintains quality and provides continuous visibility into project status.

## Problem Statement

Developers using Claude Code often face:
- Lack of consistent structure leading to variable quality outcomes
- Difficulty tracking what's been done and what remains
- Tendency to skip important phases like requirements and design
- No systematic approach to leverage existing code
- Limited visibility into current development status

## Target Users

- Software developers using Claude Code for AI-assisted development
- Teams wanting consistent, high-quality development practices
- Developers working on complex features requiring systematic breakdown
- Projects where requirements traceability and documentation matter

## Core Value Propositions

1. **Proven Methodology**: Enforces a 4-phase process (Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation) based on industry best practices
2. **Quality Assurance**: Each phase requires explicit approval, preventing rushed or incomplete work
3. **Project Visibility**: Real-time dashboards and status tracking keep developers aware of progress
4. **Code Reuse First**: Systematic analysis of existing code prevents reinventing the wheel
5. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Structured approach lets developers focus on one task at a time

## Key Features

### Current
- Automated spec workflow with 8 slash commands
- Requirements generation with EARS format
- Technical design with code reuse analysis
- Task breakdown with atomic, trackable items
- Real-time web dashboard for monitoring
- Multi-project dashboard for managing multiple specs
- Auto-generated task commands for easier execution
- Steering documents for persistent project context

### Future Considerations
- CLI-based dashboard (though web version provides similar features)
- Tunnel feature for sharing dashboards with management via secure links
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Team collaboration features
- Metrics and analytics on development velocity
- AI-powered requirement and design suggestions

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Number of projects using the workflow
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of specs that go through all phases
- **Quality Indicators**: Reduced bugs, better test coverage
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Feedback on workflow effectiveness
- **Time Savings**: Reduced time from idea to implementation

## Design Principles

1. **Zero Configuration**: Works immediately after setup
2. **Developer-Friendly**: Integrates naturally with Claude Code
3. **Flexible Yet Structured**: Enforces process without being rigid
4. **Transparency**: Always clear what phase you're in and what's next
5. **Documentation as Code**: All specs live in the repository

## Product Boundaries

### What It Is
- A development workflow automation tool
- A systematic approach to feature implementation
- A project status tracking system
- A code quality enforcement mechanism

### What It Isn't
- A project management tool (no Gantt charts, resource allocation)
- A code generator (developers still write the code)
- A testing framework (though it encourages test-driven development)
- A deployment tool (stops at implementation)
