# Dashboard Strategy

## Purpose

The Claude Code Spec Workflow dashboards provide real-time visibility into the spec-driven development process. They ensure developers and stakeholders can track progress, understand project status at a glance, and maintain awareness of what's been completed and what remains.

## User Personas

### Primary Users

- **Individual Developers**: Need to track their own spec progress across multiple features
  - Monitor task completion status
  - See which phase they're in (requirements, design, tasks, implementation)
  - Quick access to current task details
  
- **Development Teams**: Need visibility across multiple projects and team members
  - Track progress across different specs and projects
  - Identify bottlenecks or stalled specs
  - Coordinate work on related features

### Future Users

- **Project Managers/Stakeholders**: Need high-level progress visibility (via tunnel feature)
  - View overall project health
  - Track feature completion rates
  - Monitor development velocity

## Information Architecture

### Key Views

1. **Single Project Dashboard** (`claude-spec-dashboard`)
   - Steering documents status (product.md, tech.md, structure.md presence)
   - Active specs with progress bars
   - Current phase for each spec
   - Task breakdown with completion status
   - Code reuse/leverage information
   - Git branch and commit info

2. **Multi-Project Dashboard** (`claude-spec-dashboard --multi`)
   - Project discovery and health status
   - Active sessions across all projects
   - Current task being worked on per project
   - Aggregate progress metrics
   - Quick navigation between projects

## Real-time Requirements

- **Live Updates**: 
  - Task completion status changes immediately
  - New specs appear without refresh
  - Phase transitions update instantly
  - File changes trigger immediate updates

- **Periodic Refresh**:
  - Git status updates every 30 seconds
  - Project health checks every minute

- **Manual Refresh**:
  - Force refresh via browser reload
  - Re-scan for new projects (multi-dashboard)

## Performance Targets

- **Initial Load**: < 1 second for dashboard display
- **Update Latency**: < 100ms from file change to UI update
- **WebSocket Reconnection**: < 5 seconds after disconnect
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 10+ browser tabs without degradation
- **File Watching**: Minimal CPU usage (< 1% idle)

## Technology Stack

- **Server**: Fastify with WebSocket support
- **Frontend**: petite-vue (6kb) for minimal overhead
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS via CDN
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for instant updates
- **File Watching**: Chokidar for efficient monitoring
- **Port Management**: Smart allocation with fallback options

## Accessibility & Sharing

- **Authentication**: None (local development tool)
- **Port Configuration**: Customizable via --port flag
- **Auto-open**: Browser launch via --open flag
- **Multiple Instances**: Support for different ports

### Future Sharing Features

- **Tunnel Support**: Secure tunnel for remote access
  - Read-only access for stakeholders
  - Temporary share links
  - No authentication burden on viewers
- **Export Capabilities**: 
  - Progress reports as PDF/HTML
  - Spec documentation bundles
  - Timeline visualizations

## Visual Design

- **Progress Indicators**: Clear visual progress bars
- **Status Colors**: 
  - Green: Completed
  - Blue: In Progress
  - Gray: Pending
  - Yellow: Steering docs missing
- **Expandable Sections**: Detailed task views on demand
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on tablets and larger screens

## Future Enhancements

### Near Term
- **Tunneling**: Cloudflare/ngrok integration for secure sharing
- **Notifications**: Browser notifications for phase completions
- **Search**: Quick search across all specs and tasks
- **Filtering**: Show only active/completed/stalled specs

### Long Term
- **CLI Dashboard**: Terminal-based alternative (though web provides most value)
- **Historical View**: Progress over time analytics
- **Team Features**: Multiple developer coordination
- **API Access**: REST endpoints for CI/CD integration
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile dashboard for on-the-go monitoring

## Development Principles

1. **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, fast load times
2. **Real-time First**: Changes visible immediately
3. **Self-contained**: Dashboard can run independently
4. **Zero Config**: Works out of the box
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work everywhere

## Metrics for Success

- **Adoption Rate**: % of users who use dashboard regularly
- **Session Duration**: How long users keep dashboard open
- **Feature Usage**: Which views/features get most use
- **Performance**: Consistent sub-100ms update times
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime during development sessions
