Analyze the codebase before starting requirements. This is the FIRST step in the spec workflow.

## What this does:
1. Examines the project structure and architecture
2. Identifies existing patterns, utilities, and components
3. Creates a comprehensive analysis for code reuse opportunities
4. Prepares context for the requirements phase

## Instructions:
1. Search for and analyze key files (package.json, main entry points, core modules)
2. Identify architectural patterns and conventions
3. Document reusable components, utilities, and patterns
4. Note any constraints or technical requirements
5. Summarize findings in preparation for requirements

This analysis ensures new features leverage existing code and follow established patterns.
