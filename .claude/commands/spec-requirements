Create or review requirements for the current feature.

## For new requirements:
1. Create requirements.md in the feature's spec directory
2. Define user stories with EARS format acceptance criteria
3. Include code reuse analysis section based on prior analysis
4. Document success metrics and non-functional requirements

## For existing requirements:
1. Read and display the current requirements.md
2. Validate completeness of user stories
3. Ensure acceptance criteria follow EARS format
4. Check for code reuse analysis section
5. Confirm requirements are ready for design phase

## Requirements must include:
- Clear user stories
- EARS format acceptance criteria (WHEN, WHERE, WHILE, IF conditions)
- Code reuse analysis priorities
- Success metrics
- Non-functional requirements

Move to design phase only after requirements are complete and approved.
