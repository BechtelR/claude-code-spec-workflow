Start the spec workflow for the spec-workflow-enhancements feature.

This creates the initial requirements document template in .claude/specs/spec-workflow-enhancements/requirements.md

The workflow follows these phases:
1. Requirements: Define user stories and acceptance criteria
2. Design: Create technical design with code reuse analysis
3. Tasks: Break down into atomic implementation tasks
4. Implementation: Execute tasks one at a time

Run this command to begin the structured development process.
