Initialize the spec-steering feature workflow.

This command sets up the spec workflow for the "spec-steering" feature - an enhancement that provides intelligent guidance and automation throughout the spec workflow process.

## What spec-steering will do:
- Provide intelligent prompts and suggestions during each phase
- Automate common patterns and boilerplate generation
- Validate phase transitions and completeness
- Offer context-aware assistance based on project type
- Track and learn from workflow patterns

## To begin:
1. First run /spec-analyze to analyze the codebase
2. Then create requirements in .claude/specs/spec-steering/requirements.md
3. Follow the workflow through design, tasks, and implementation phases

This meta-feature will help make the spec workflow more intelligent and user-friendly.
