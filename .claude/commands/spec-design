Create or review the technical design document.

## For new design:
1. Create design.md based on approved requirements
2. Include detailed code reuse analysis with specific files/functions
3. Define architectural approach and component breakdown
4. Document API contracts and data flows
5. Identify risks and mitigation strategies

## For existing design:
1. Read and validate the current design.md
2. Ensure all requirements are addressed
3. Verify code reuse opportunities are leveraged
4. Check technical approach aligns with project standards
5. Confirm design is ready for task breakdown

## Design must include:
- Code Reuse Analysis (with specific file references)
- Architectural overview
- Component specifications
- API/Interface definitions
- Data flow diagrams (text-based)
- Risk assessment

Move to tasks phase only after design is complete and approved.
